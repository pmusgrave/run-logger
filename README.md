# Run Logger

Logs your distance and time when you walk or run. This device uses a GPS module to track position, and includes an ESP32 WiFi/BLE microcontroller to synchronize data to the cloud automatically, using an extremely simple and familiar user interface. Just like a classic stopwatch, this has a simple 3-button, start, stop, reset interface.

Yes, I know you can use a smartphone app to log your distance when you run. Smartphones have a few drawbacks in my opinion:
1. They are expensive. I have dropped phones plenty of times and I don't want to risk that amount of wear on my phone when I exercise. Even if you don't drop the phone, exercise obviously produces a lot of sweat, and this moisture causes a lot of additional wear on phones. A lower cost solution gives me peace of mind that I won't be damaging a costly smartphone.
2. They are relatively heavy. It might not seem like much, but when you're running a long distance, any extra weight tends to add up over time.
3. They are relatively large and bulky. Again, it might not seem like much, but I personally dislike having a phone jostle around in my pocket in these situations. The less encumbrance the better.

This is a low-weight, low-cost, low-power wearable device to keep you focused on the trail in front of you.
